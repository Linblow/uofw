/**
 * This structure represents a unique per-console identifier. It contains console specific information and can be used,
 * for example, for DRM purposes and simple PSP hardware model checks.
 *
 * @remark On the PSP, Sony uses the term "PSID" (not to mixup with the term "OpenPSID" which represents a different set of
 * unique identifier bits). On later consoles, like the PS Vita and PS4, Sony uses the term "ConsoleId" for this set of
 * identifier bits. To be consistent within the PS family, we are going with the term "ConsoleId" here, even though APIs like
 * sceOpenPSIDGetPSID() (which returns the ConsoleId) will remain as originally named by Sony.
